Please DO NOT COPY FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES FOR YOUR OWN BETTER IF YOU WANT TO BE BETTER IN INTERVIEWS, I HAVE GIVEN THE HINTS AND INSTRUCTIONS, ANY DOUBTS OR HASSLES  PLS ,YOU ARE WELCOME TO REACH ME ON MY WHATSAPP, WILL BE HAPPY TO GUIDE YOU BETTER

#  Objective

Fix the broken Spring Boot project and make all APIs work correctly.

You are NOT allowed to rewrite everything.
You must debug and fix existing code.

#  SECTION 1: BUG FIX TASKS

##  1. Employee.java Issues

###  Problems in code:
- Entity is not properly mapped
- Missing annotations
- Getters and setters are incorrect
- Missing default constructor

###  Your Task:
Write answers for:

1. Which annotation is missing to make this a database table?
---ANS--- The missing annotation is '@Entity', for @Entity tells JPA/Hibernate that the class should be mapped to a database table.

2. Why do we need a default constructor in JPA?
---ANS--- JPA uses reflection to create objects when reading data from the database.Without a default constructor, Hibernate cannot create an object of the entity class and may throw an exception such as: "No default constructor for entity" Therefore, every JPA entity should have a no-argument constructor.

3. Fix all getter and setter methods
---ANS--- All the getter methods will use a return type required of specific parameters with no needed parameter inside the parenthesis, whereas in setter methods the return type will be void whereas the parenthesis will have paramters inside of it for example as such: public Long getId() { return id; } public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; }

4. What happens if @Id is missing?
---ANS--- JPA cannot identify the primary key of the entity. At application startup, Hibernate will throw an error similar to: Entity 'Employee' has no identifier OR No identifier specified for entity Because every JPA entity must have exactly one primary key field marked with @Id.

---

##  2. Repository Issues

### Problems:
- Repository is not extending JpaRepository

###  Your Task:

1. Why do we extend JpaRepository?
---ANS--- We extend JpaRepository because it provides ready-made CRUD operations without writing SQL queries or implementation code. By extending JpaRepository, we automatically get methods like: save,findAll,findById,etc.

2. What happens if we don't extend it?
---ANS--- If we don't extend it, then there will be no CRUD methods available to use, and we cannot call repository implementation such as, repo.save, repo.findAll, repo.findById, etc. because spring data JPA will not create a repository implementation automatically. Compilation errors such as: "The method save(Employee) is undefined" may show up.

3. Fix repository so CRUD works
---ANS--- We extend EmployeeRepository to JpaRepository<Employee, Long>, where: -Employee → Entity class -Long → Data type of primary key (id) And even import, org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository & com.example.demo.entity.Employee.

##  3. Controller Issues

### Problems:
- Missing annotations (@RestController, @RequestMapping)
- Missing @RequestBody and @PathVariable
- Methods returning null
- Repository not injected properly

##  4. application.properties Issues

### Problems:
- Incorrect datasource configuration
- Missing H2 settings
- App not starting

###  Your Task:

1. Why do we need application.properties?
---ANS--- We need it because, for it is the central and most important configuration file in Spring Boot, where it configures, server ports, database connections, JPA/Hibernate settings, logging, security settings, custom application properties. Without proper configuration, Spring Boot may fail to connect to the database or start the application correctly.

2. What is H2 database used for?
---ANS--- H2 is a lightweight, in-memory database commonly used for, learning spring boot, testing applications, rapid development, and running applications without downloading MySQL.

3. Fix configuration so application runs
---ANS--- server.port=8080 spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver spring.datasource.username=sa spring.datasource.password= spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update spring.jpa.show-sql=true spring.h2.console.enabled=true

#  SECTION 2: POSTMAN TESTING

Write answers after testing:

1. What is response of POST /employee/save?
---ANS--- The employee data is saved in the database and the saved employee object is returned. { "id":1, "name":"John", "designation":"Developer", "salary":50000 }

2. What happens if GET /employee/1 is called with invalid ID?
---ANS--- If the employee ID does not exist, the repository returns an empty Optional 'null'

3. What is returned in DELETE API?
---ANS--- The API returns a success message: Employee Deleted Successfully It's due to having the return being, return "Employee Deleted Successfully";

4. Which method is used for update?
---ANS--- The PUT method is used for updating an employee.

---

#  SECTION 3: THEORY QUESTIONS

Answer briefly:

1. What is REST API?
---ANS--- REST API is a web service that allows applications to communicate using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

2. What is CRUD?
---ANS--- CRUD, stands for create, read, update and delete, which are the basic database operations.

3. Difference between POST and PUT?
---ANS---

POST - It is used to create a new resource
PUT - It is used to update an existing resource
What is dependency injection?
---ANS--- Dependency Injection is a technique where Spring automatically provides required objects (dependencies) to a class instead of the class creating them.

4. Why do we use Spring Boot?
---ANS--- Spring Boot is used to build Java applications quickly with minimal configuration. It provides embedded servers, auto-configuration, and simplifies development of REST APIs and web applications.
